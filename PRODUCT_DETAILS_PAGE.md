### 6. **Data Parsing Intelligence**

#### OEM Number Extraction
Checks multiple possible field names:
- `oem`, `oem_no`, `oem_number`, `oem_numbers`
- `oemNumbers`, `oem_list`, `oemList`
- `OEM`, `OEM_NO` (uppercase variants)

Splits by multiple delimiters:
- Newlines (`\n`)
- Commas (`,`)
- Semicolons (`;`)
- Spaces (` `)

#### Compatibility Parsing
Extracts from various fields:
- `compatibility`, `compatibilities`
- `vehicle_compatibility`, `vehicleCompatibility`
- `fitment`, `fitments`

Handles nested structures and arrays.

#### Manufacturer Integration
- Fetches manufacturer list via `useManufacturers` hook
- Enhances product data with manufacturer images and names
- Validates manufacturer existence before display

### 7. **Integration with Existing Pages**

#### CarPartDetails.tsx
Added "View Full Details" button for selected products:
```tsx
<Link to={`/product/${ui.id}?from=...`}>
  View Full Details
</Link>
```

#### App.tsx
Route already configured:
```tsx
<Route path="/product/:id" element={<ProductDetails />} />
```

#### Other Product Links
All existing product links already point to `/product/:id`:
- `CarParts.tsx`
- `AirFresheners.tsx`
- `AccessoryCard.tsx`

## Technical Stack

### Dependencies Used
- React 18+ with TypeScript

- `normalizeApiImage(url)` - URL normalization
- `pickImage(object)` - Flexible image extraction

## Usage Examples

### Navigate to Product Details
```tsx
// From anywhere in the app
navigate(`/product/${productId}`)

// Or with Link
<Link to={`/product/${productId}`}>View Product</Link>

// With return URL
<Link to={`/product/${productId}?from=${encodeURIComponent(currentPath)}`}>
  View Product
</Link>
```

### Product Data Flow
1. User clicks product link with product ID
2. Page loads and shows skeleton
3. API calls execute in parallel:
   - Product details
   - OEM numbers
   - Reviews
4. Data is parsed and enhanced with manufacturer info
5. UI renders with all information
6. User can interact (add to cart, wishlist, copy OEM, etc.)

## Future Enhancements
